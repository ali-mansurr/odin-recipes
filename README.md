This repository contains the [**Recipes Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.  
It is a simple website built with plain **HTML** including recipes for different dishes.  

This project demonstrates my understanding of **basic HTML** such as working with text, images, links, and lists.

## Skills Practiced:
- Structuring content using **HTML** elements.
- Linking pages using `<a>` tags.
- Using **lists**.
- Getting familiar with **Git** and **GitHub**.
