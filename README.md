This repository contains the [**Recipes Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.  
It is a simple website built with plain **HTML** that showcases recipes for different dishes.  

This project demonstrates my understanding of **basic HTML structure, key HTML elements, linking pages, and organizing content in a structured way**.  

## Skills Practiced:
- Structuring content using **HTML elements**.  
- Linking pages using **absolute and relative paths** with `<a>` tags.  
- Working with **text elements** (paragraphs `<p>`, headings `<h1>-<h6>`), and **text formatting elements** (`<strong>`, `<em>`).  
- Using **lists** (`<ul>` and `<ol>`) for ingredients and cooking steps.
- Getting familiar with Git and GitHub.
