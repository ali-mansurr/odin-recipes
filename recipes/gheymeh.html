    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Khoresht Gheymeh</strong> is a traditional Persian stew made with tender 
        <strong>lamb</strong> or <strong>beef</strong>, split <strong>yellow peas</strong>, and a rich 
        <strong>tomato-based sauce</strong>. 
    
        It is flavored with <strong>dried Persian limes (limoo amani)</strong>, which add a unique tangy taste, 
        and a blend of fragrant <em>spices</em> like <em>turmeric</em>, <em>cinnamon</em>, and <em>saffron</em>. 
    
        The dish is slow-cooked until the flavors are fully developed and is typically served with 
        <strong>steamed Persian rice (chelow)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>A signature topping of crispy <strong>fried potatoes</strong> adds the perfect crunch, making this stew both <em>savory</em> and <em>comforting</em>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of meat (lamb or beef), rinsed and cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup yellow split peas, picked over and washed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, peeled, chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>4-5 dried limes (limoo amani).Soak them in water for 5 minutes and then pierce them in a few places with a dinner fork</li>
        <li>Â½  teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>A pinch of cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon  rosewater *optional</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large potatoes, peeled, sliced and fried for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a small pot over medium heat, 
            add the tomato paste and saute for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, 
            until it starts to change color. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large pan over medium heat, 
            add the onions and saute until they are translucent, 
            add turmeric and stir well. After a minute or two, add the meat and brown on all sides. 
            Add salt, pepper, and a pinch of cinnamon. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Add the yellow split peas to the pot and saute for 5 minutes, spoon in the tomato paste. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Add water to cover all the ingredients in the pot by 1-2 inches. Add in the dried limes. 
            Lower the heat, cover, and cook for about 1-1/4 hours or until the meat is well-cooked.  
            Add a little bit of water and adjust the seasoning when needed.</li>
        <li>Yellow split peas shouldn't turn too soft and mushy, they still need to have a bit of bite to them. 
            You may parboil them separately until they are just tender and add them to the pot in the last 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the last ten minutes add the rosewater if you like.</li>
        <li>Serve Gheymeh in a large bowl, topped with a layer of fries. Enjoy it warm with basmati
